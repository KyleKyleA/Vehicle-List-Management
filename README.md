Vehicle Management System
Overview

The Vehicle Management System is a C# and .NET-based application developed as an academic project and showcased as part of my professional portfolio. The purpose of this project is to design and implement a user-friendly system for managing different types of vehicles, such as cars and jet skis, while applying core software development principles.

The application allows users to add, update, delete, and view vehicle records. Vehicle data is stored using JSON files to ensure persistence and easy retrieval across sessions.
