# Vehicle Management System

## Overview
The **Vehicle Management System** is a C# and .NET-based application developed as a school project and included in my professional portfolio. This application allows users to manage different types of vehicles, such as cars and jet skis, through a clean and user-friendly interface.

Users can add, update, delete, and view vehicle records. Vehicle data is stored in JSON files to ensure persistence and easy data retrieval between application sessions.
